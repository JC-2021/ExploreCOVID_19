# Explore-COVID_19
The project focuses on the investigation of the data about the current global pandemic COVID-19 named by World Health Organization on 2/11/2020. In the present, many people around the world care about the trends of COVID-19 and how it is going to further affect our daily lives. It is crucial for us to know about the current spread situation of COVID-19 within US as well as around the globe. Data visualization and prediction in this project will allow us to have a better insight of the ongoing situation of the disease. Image classification will provide a classification technique of interest that could potentially be used to classify chest X-ray images of COVID-19.
